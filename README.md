# Matrix-Calculator

A simple python program that computes basic matrix operations. So far
the implemented operations are:
* Matrix Addition
* Matrix Subtraction
* Scalar Multiplication
* Matrix Multiplication

Will later implement the following:
* Invertibility/Inverse
* Determinant
* Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
